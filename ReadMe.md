# BlazorAppClientFileUpload

During testing desktop pcs with a large amount of memory work well. However on systems with a low amount of memory the browser will crash.

On my iPad Air (4th generation iOS version 14.5) I can resize about 400 pictures but after that point it will crash the browser.
I setup a demo site to demonstrate the issue: https://blazorimageresize.azurewebsites.net

Here is a recording of the browser crash on the iOS device: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WR7ykyR7Q0tYb0D5umrj2J6odTvRsPCa/view?usp=sharing
